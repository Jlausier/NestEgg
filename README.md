## This little doo hickey is our very own budgeting app called Wallet Wizard, with this you can keep track of your spending habits to see what does and doesn't need work with your budget.
- REASON: The reason why this project was done, this type of app that was built is very relatable to the majority of us and our peers, so why not contribute by building something that can help them and even us with our money managing skills?
- PROBLEM SOLVED: This could help individuals with their money managing issues as they move forward.
- MOTIVATION: Trying a new project definitely gives a sense of fulfilment in its own right but completing that project... maaaan just give yourself a good pat on the back bud.
- WHAT WAS LEARNED: Same thing that was learned in previous projects and homeworks, the code must be precise with little to no error and the code from css, js, and html must have relation to one another.
## Installation For those who are not familiar with how to start react js (Like this guy until now). First you would type in "npm i" in the terminal where you would see all the pretty coding messages pop up. After setting all the right code in the needed js whether its index, app, script, etc type in "npm start" to get the react app started in which it will give you a message saying the app has commenced successfully.
